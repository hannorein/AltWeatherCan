# Alt Weather Canada

This app has been created by Hanno Rein. Its purpose is to provide a simple and intuitive way to view weather information for your location. The functionality and design tries to replicate the old WeatherCan App that was developed by Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). The development of this alternative app was triggered by the redesign of the WeatherCan App in October 2024 which significantly reduced readability due to a low contrast colour scheme and a reduced information density. Not all features found in the original WeatherCan App have been replicated yet. Contributions and bug reports are welcome!
